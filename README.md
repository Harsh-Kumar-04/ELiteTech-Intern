# To-Do List App - Internship Project

This is the first project developed during my internship at EliteTech Intern. The project is a simple To-Do List App that allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, and deleting them. It demonstrates my skills in both front-end and back-end development, including the use of databases for persistent task storage.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Store tasks in a database for persistence

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vanilla JS)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (or another preferred backend framework)
- **Database**: MongoDB / MySQL / PostgreSQL (based on your choice)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
